## Type Inference Overview

`TypeInferencer` is a plain and compact implementation of "type inference" used in computer language processing systems. In general, the process of type inference is implemented inside a language processor. The language processors we are most familiar with, such as `F#`, `OCaml`, `Haskell`, and `Java`, have static type systems. Alternatively, dynamically typed systems may do some type inference to optimize their execution.

Type inference is the automatic computation and indication of the type of an expression by the processor, without explicitly indicating the type. For example :

```fsharp
// [*] F# expression - (1)
let f x = x + 1

// [*] Result of the inference - (2)
let f (x:int) : (int -> int) = x:int + 1:int
````

* Note: Pseudocode is marked with `[*]` to distinguish F# pseudocode from code that tries out `TypeInferencer`.

Usually, when people write code, they do not specify the type as in (1). Therefore, by using a type inferencer, we can automatically calculate and derive what type can be applied to each term of an expression, as in (2).

Although various methods have been devised for type inference, `TypeInferencer` implements `Algorithm W` and `Algorithm M`, which are typical methods for introducing type inference, and can be used in different ways.

* `Algorithm W` determines the type of an expression from the top (root) to the bottom (leaf) of the parse tree.
* `Algorithm W` determines the type of an expression's syntax tree from the top (root) to the bottom (leaf), while `Algorithm M` does the opposite: it determines the type of an expression's syntax tree from the bottom (leaf) to the top (root).

(A syntax tree is an abstract syntax tree. It will be shown later.)

There is no difference in the meaning of the inferred results in both cases. First, `Algorithm W` was presented, and later `Algorithm M` was presented. The reason why different methods were studied is that `Algorithm M` is better at localizing where the type problem is found.

Although `TypeInferencer` does not specify the exact location of the problem when it occurs during type inference, many processors and IDEs may want to point out the error as locally as possible in the code. In such a case, `Algorithm M` can give more desirable results.

## What TypeInferencer can do.

`TypeInferencer` is a type inferencer. Usually, a computer language processor contains the following elements: 1:

`Lexer` and `Parser`: The source code is written in a text-based format. The first step is to reinterpret this into a structure that is easily recognized by the computer. The `Lexer` and `Parser` play this role and generate a syntax tree from the source code. 2.
`Type checker`: A type checker. The `Type checker`: a type checker, which types each node of the syntax tree appropriately. Alternatively, it can check if it is properly typed or not. 3.
3. `Reducer` or evaluator: Evaluates each node of a parse tree. Evaluating results in the execution of an expression. Typically corresponds to an "interpreter". 4.
4. `Code generator`: Generates independent code from a parse tree. Generates code that runs directly on the target. In general, it corresponds to a "compiler".

Not all language processing systems implement all the features. For example, a processor based on a dynamic type system might omit steps 2 and 4.

We can say that `TypeInferencer` is a part of the implementation of `Type checker` in 2. Therefore, you need to prepare a syntax tree as input. This can be written as follows:

```fsharp
// Load the NuGet package.
#r "nuget: TypeInferencer"

// Namespaces and modules to use
open TypeInferencer

// (canned up to this point, omitted in subsequent examples)

// ----------------------

// Assemble a syntax tree, equivalent to the following code fragment
// `let f = fun x -> x 1 in f`
let expr =
    ELet("f", // let f =
        EAbs("x", // fun x ->
            EApp(EVar "x", ELit(LInt 1)) // x 1
        ),
        EVar "f" // in f
    )

// (After this, use TypeInferencer)
````

You may be wondering, "Isn't it possible to write expressions in a more natural way? You may be wondering, ``How can I write expressions in a more natural way? You may be wondering, "Isn't it possible to write expressions in a more natural way?

```fsharp
// Write the source code as a string.
let code = "let f = fun x -> x 1 in f"

// Can we convert it to a parse tree?
let expr = parse code
Let expr = parse code

It would be more convenient if you could write something like The role of the `Lexer` and `Parser` is to do such conversions. Therefore, the `TypeInferencer` does not include such a feature.

However, there is no need to be disappointed. If you need to tackle such a task in practice, it is already in your hands. [F# Compiler Service](https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-compiler-docs/).

It covers the complete F# functionality, without excesses or deficiencies. It includes all of the public APIs for `Lexer`, `Parser`, `Type checker`, and `Code generator`, which can be used individually or in combination. You can use them individually or in combination. You may even integrate them into your own applications.

However, the F# language specification is complex, and the syntax tree used to represent its structure is also huge and complex. For many people, the F# syntax tree is not easy to understand why such a node definition is necessary, and it is also difficult to handle.

On the other hand, `TypeInferencer` is focused only on type inference, and has a minimal number of syntax trees. In other words :

* What is a syntax tree?
* Concrete methods for type inference.
* What happens when you perform type inference, or how a particular syntax tree is inferred.

In particular, it should be easier to find out about F# 6.0.

In particular, since F# 6.0, the debugging information has been greatly improved, so using the debugger to trace the internal implementation will help you understand it.

(In that case, you may want to clone this repository and run the debug from the test code instead of the NuGet package.)

Perhaps if you can understand the structure of a naive type system like `TypeInferencer`, you can practice metaprogramming with more complex and practical language processors like the F# compiler service.

## TypeInferencer syntax tree

The nodes of a parse tree are defined recursively as follows:

```fsharp
// Type for each node of the parse tree
type public Exp =
    | EVar of name:string
    | ELit of literal:Lit
    | EApp of func:Exp * arg:Exp
    | EApp of func:Exp * arg:Exp
    | ELet of name:string * expr:Exp * body:Exp
    | EFix of func:string * name:string * expr:Exp
````

There are six types of nodes in total. Each of them is described below.
---.

## ELit (literal value)

First, let's try to infer the type of literal value, which is the easiest and simplest to understand. Literal values in the code are represented by a node called `ELit`. The following defines an integer value of `123` and infers it:

``fsharp
// Direct value: 123
let expr = ELit (LInt 123)

// actual = TInt
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
```

* `TopDown` is also fine with `BottomUp`. The difference is whether to use `Algorithm W` or `Algorithm M`. In `TypeInferencer`, the meaning of the result does not make any difference.
* `TypeEnv` is called the "type environment", but for now we'll assume it's code generated from an empty list.
* The `show` function converts the resulting type to a human-readable string. For literal-valued types, you will get results without the `T` prefix, like `Int`. If you want to get the full definition, use `printfn "%A" actual`.

If you apply this syntax tree to the `infer` function, you will get back a value of `TInt`. This means that we have deduced that the value `123` is an integer type.

Similarly, if we apply the :

``fsharp
// Direct value: true
let expr = ELit (LBool true)

// actual = TBool
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
```

In this case, `TBool` is returned. We have literally inferred that it is a boolean type.

Here is the definition of the `Lit` type that can be specified as an argument to `ELit`:

````fsharp
// Type used to specify arguments to ELit.
type public Lit =.
    | LInt of value:int32
    | LBool of value:bool
````fsharp

You may want to try other types of values, but see also the definitions of `TInt` and `TBool` before you do:

```fsharp
// A type that indicates the type of the parse tree (see below for TVar and TFun)
type public Type =
    | TInt
    | TBool
    | TVar of name:string
    | TFun of parameterType:Type * resultType:Type
```.

`TInt` and `TBool` are values defined by the type `Type`. (You may be confused about what is a type and what is a value until you get used to it. Also, the `Type` type is not the `System.Type` type in .NET, which is our own definition.)

Actually, there are only four types that `TypeInferencer` can recognize. In other words, for literal values, there are only integer types and boolean types. Therefore, to support other types (e.g., floating point, string, etc.), we need to increase the number of these variations or devise a better internal implementation.

There are other questions as well. Since we have gone to the trouble of defining the nodes of the parse tree as `LInt` and `LBool`, isn't it natural that their types should be attributed to `TInt` and `TBool`? This is the point.

In fact, even the internal implementation [returns the result by hardcoding it this way](https://github.com/kekyo/TypeInferencer/blob/main/TypeInferencer/AlgorithmW.fs#L34).

`TypeInferencer` did not increase the number of type definitions, nor did it introduce flexibility. Modifying it to add more types of literal values is relatively easy, but as shown earlier, it is confusing if you are not familiar with value, type, value of type, etc.

The current internal structure of `TypeInferencer` helps us understand it, thanks to F#'s guarantee of implementation consistency (literally, with F#'s type system). This is also because the goal was to reproduce as closely as possible the paper on which the implementation was based.

---.

### EAbs and EVar (anonymous functions and free variables)

An anonymous function is an expression using ``fun`` in F#:

``fsharp
// [*] Define an anonymous function and bind it with the name f.
let f = fun x -> x + 1
```

Define such an expression with `EAbs` (note that `let` is not included):

```fsharp
// Define an anonymous function.
// `fun x -> 123`.
let expr = EAbs("x", ELit(LInt 123))

// actual = a0 -> TInt
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

The result of evaluating this syntax tree is `a0 -> TInt`, and this type is defined by `TFun`. This means "a function type that takes a value of unknown type `a0` and returns type `TInt`".

Since the body expression of `EAbs` is `LInt`, we know that it returns `TInt` in a fixed way. On the other hand, there is no information about the parameter variable `x`, and it is not used in the main expression, so there is no material for inference. In the end, the inference ends with the type of `x` unknown, and the parameter argument part is of type `a0`.

The unknown type `a0` acts as a placeholder, and if the type is found during inference, it will converge to that type. This placeholder is called a "type variable" (or free type variable) and is represented by `TVar`.

The function type `TFun` and the type variable `TVar` can also be defined manually as follows:

``fsharp
// a0 -> TInt
let typ = TFun(TVar "a0", TInt)

// Make sure it matches exactly - (1)
let typ = TFun(TVar "a0", TInt)
System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert((typ = actual))
````

To check the content of a type, you can use a pattern matching expression:

```fsharp
// Check for an exact match - (2)
System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(
    match actual with
    | TFun(TVar name, TInt) when name = "a0" -> true
    | _ -> false
)
````

`TypeInferencer` assigns a [mechanically generated number](https://github.com/kekyo/TypeInferencer/blob/main/TypeInferencer/InferState.fs#L19) to the placeholder. . Note that this number may vary depending on the structure of the syntax tree. Therefore, rather than defining it manually, it is recommended to use it to check if it is consistent with other inferred `TVar`.

Here is also a description of `EVar` (not `TVar`), which makes it possible to refer to the parameter argument variable `x`:

``fsharp
// Define an anonymous function and use the parameter variable in the body expression.
// `fun x -> x`.
let funcexpr = EAbs("x", EVar "x")

// actual = a0 -> a0
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) funcexpr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

You can specify the variable you want to refer to with `EVar`. You can specify the variable you want to refer to with `EVar`, which is called a "free variable". (Parameter variables are sometimes called "bound variables" because they can be considered bound.)

Although `EVar` and `TVar` are similar, the difference is whether the target is a concrete value or a type.

The result `a0 -> a0` shows that "the whole thing is a function type, and the argument and result types are both unknown, but they match.

It would not be very interesting to just define an anonymous function. We need to apply the following function.

---.

### EApp (function application)

Applying a function means that you define a function as follows, and the arguments are applied to that function:

```fsharp
// [*] Define an anonymous function in F#.
let f = fun x -> x
// let f x = x // Can also be defined as let in F#.

// [*] apply function to argument (result is 123)
f 123
````

`EApp` is a node that defines such a function application:

```fsharp
// Define an anonymous function.
// `fun x -> x`.
let funcexpr = EAbs("x", EVar "x")

// Apply anonymous function to 123
// `(fun x -> x) 123`.
let expr = EApp(funcexpr, ELit(LInt 123))

// actual = TInt
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

We have arrived at an example where this is what we can call inference. Since the anonymous function returns the parameter argument `x` as is, we should be able to infer that it returns the same type as `x`. Therefore, we can deduce that the type `TInt` of `123` given by the function application is returned by the anonymous function, resulting in `TInt`. Similarly, if you use :

``fsharp
// Apply the anonymous function to true.
// `(fun x -> x) true`.
let expr = EApp(funcexpr, ELit(LBool true))

// actual = TBool
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

Even though it is the same anonymous function definition, the inferred result changes depending on the type of argument given, and we can confirm that it is indeed inferred.

Now let's look at a few more different examples:

```fsharp
// Apply function true to 123 (?)
// `true 123`.
let expr = EApp(ELit(LBool true), ELit(LInt 123))

// uncaught UnificationException
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
````

The expression `true 123` is unsettling to look at. The expression ```` `true`''' is unsettling to look at, and at first glance you know it's not going to work, but consider why:

* `true` is a literal value. Its type is boolean, or `TBool`.
* By applying `true` to `123`, we are assuming that `true` is a function. The type of a function is a function type, or `TFun`, as explained in `EAbs`.

If we consider what the assumed function type is, we can think of it as "a function type that takes an integer type as an argument and whose result type is unknown. In other words, it should be something like `TInt -> a0`.

And there is no way to reconcile a boolean type with a function type `TInt -> a0`. This problem was discovered in `TypeInferencer` [during the process called "identification"](https://github.com/kekyo/TypeInferencer/blob/main/TypeInferencer/Unification.fs#L43), and an exception was thrown. It was thrown.

--- ### Coffee break

### Coffee break

Here's an interesting example of an anonymous function definition:

```fsharp
// `fun x = x x`.
let expr = EAbs("x", EApp(EVar "x", EVar "x"))

// uncaught OccurrenceException
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
````

This expression will raise an exception. In fact, we can't infer this syntax tree. Please think about why. You may not be able to sleep tonight...

---.

### ELet (binding)

This node is equivalent to `let`, which has been shown in many examples of F# code. This is a node corresponding to `let`, which has been shown in many examples of F# code. Let's review it just in case:

````fsharp
// [*] Binding
let x = 123

// [*] refer to the bound variable
printfn "%d" x
```

If you have recently started using F#, you may not be aware of this. This notation is called the "lightweight syntax", and can actually be written as follows, which is semantically more accurate (called the "verbose syntax"):

```fsharp
// [*] to bind
let x = 123
in
  // [*] refer to the bound variable
  printfn "%d" x
The ``.

`in` determines the scope of the binding, and the variable `x` can only be used within this scope. `ELet` defines this faithfully:

``fsharp
// `let x = 123 in x`.
let expr =
    ELet("x",
        ELit(LInt 123),
        EVar "x" // expression in scope body
    )

// actual = TInt
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
```

This syntax tree will eventually return `123`, so the inference result is `TInt`.

Of course, you can also bind anonymous functions:

```fsharp
// `let f = fun x -> x in f 123`.
let expr =
    ELet("f",
        EAbs("x", EVar "x"),
        EApp(EVar "f", ELit(LInt 123))
    )

// actual = TInt
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

At this point, it's probably getting difficult for humans to do accurate type inference. There are more interesting examples:

```fsharp
// `let f = fun x -> fun y -> x y in f (fun z -> z) 123`.
let expr =
    ELet("f",
        EAbs("x", EAbs("y", EApp(EVar "x", EVar "y"))),
        EApp(EApp(EVar "f", EAbs("z", EVar "z"))), ELit(LInt 123))
    )

// actual = TInt
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

You can see that the type of the function and the type of the result of applying the function are tracked correctly. The interesting part is that in this example, `x` is evaluated as a function type.

If you look at a complex syntax tree like this, you will notice something. Take a good look at the following code example:

```fsharp
// [*] Anonymous function and function application pairs
(fun x -> 123) true

// [*] Binding expression
let x = true in 123 
````

I should have understood this implicitly, but I was surprised to see the result actually inferred. That is, the bound expression can be substituted by a pair of anonymous functions and function applications. Let's see if this is true:

``fsharp
// `(fun x -> 123) true`.
let expr1 = EApp(EAbs("x", ELit(LInt 123)), ELit(LBool true))

// `let x = true in 123`.
let expr2 = ELet("x", ELit(LBool true), ELit(LInt 123))

// actual1 = actual2 = TInt
let actual1 = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr1
let actual2 = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr2
printfn "%s = %s" (show actual1) (show actual2)
````

Aside: In Javascript, the scope of variables is quite loose, so there is a danger of accidentally reassigning values. In such cases, there are techniques for creating pseudo-scopes using anonymous functions and function application, such as the one shown here.

Of course, nesting of `ELet` is also possible, although it is not shown here. This is something you should check out for yourself.

---.

### EFix (immovable points)

In general, recursive functions cannot be defined by just using `let`:

````fsharp
// [*] Define a recursive function
let f x = f x // f is not defined
in
  f 123
```

In F#, you can define recursive functions by using ``let rec``:

```fsharp
// [*] Correct definition.
let rec f x: int = f x // The type of the result cannot be deduced, so it is assumed to be int (type annotation).
in
  f 123
````

* Note: Of course, this expression will lead to an infinite loop.

The reason it can't be done with `let` is that the scope of the free variables that appear in the binding expression is outside the `let` binding expression. As shown in `ELet`, the scopes that can refer to bound variables are `let ... in ... F#'s `let rec` relaxes this restriction.

In `TypeInferencer`, the use of `EFix` makes it possible to define recursive functions:

````fsharp
// `fix f x = f x`.
let expr =
    EFix("f",
        "x",
        EApp(EVar "f", EVar "x"))

// actual = a0 -> a1
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

In fact, this just defines a recursive function (and its type is `a0 -> a1`). To make it the same expression as `let rec`, bind it as follows:

``fsharp
// `let f = fix fi x = fi x in f 123`.
let expr =
    ELet("f",
        EFix("fi", // renamed to `fi` for clarity (optional)
            "x",
            EApp(EVar "fi", EVar "x")),
        EApp(EVar "f", ELit(LInt 123))))

// actual = a0
let actual = infer TopDown (TypeEnv []) expr
printfn "%s" (show actual)
````

Just as the type of the result could not be inferred in the F# code example, neither could the `TypeInferencer`. If you return the value of the result, you can infer the type of the value.

Note that the name `EFix` comes from "immovable point". The name `EFix` comes from `immovable point`. The concept of immovable point is hard to understand intuitively, so it is better to refer to various references. ([Example from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator))

## Limitations and developmental topics

The above is a description of the syntax tree and inference that `TypeInferencer` has. As partly shown in the text, it has the following limitations and their solutions compared to practical language processing systems:

* Literal values are only available in integer and boolean types.
  * It is not very difficult to change `ELit` to directly handle direct values in the host environment (all instances inherited from `obj` in .
* There are not enough node species to perform practical calculations.
  * There are not enough node species to do practical calculations, for example, pattern matching expressions and `if ... then ... else`, so we cannot define realistic expressions. In the explanation of `EFix`, we could not show a realistic example of a recursive function because we could not implement a stop condition.
  * It is possible to define a node like `EIf`, and it has been well studied, so you should follow various papers.
  * It is possible to define nodes like `EIf`, and it is well studied, so you should follow various papers. Of course, it is also a good idea to try to define node species that correspond directly to these. In that case, we need to face the fundamental question of functional languages, whether a function returns a value or not.
* Type annotations cannot be applied to each node of a parse tree.
  * You cannot apply type annotations to every node of a parse tree. As shown in the F# example in `EFix`, it is sometimes better to manually annotate some terms with types to make better inferences and help our understanding. You may also want to refer to the existing work on partial type annotation of parse trees.
* Type composition is not possible.
  * Functional languages such as F# can define tuple and algebraic data types. This allows for more flexible and complex definitions, but `TypeInferencer` does not have such node definition and inference capabilities.
  * Dealing with algebraic data types is complicated by how to handle the structure of records and whether to allow partial field alignment.
* Partial typing is not possible.
  * Partial typing means that the inheritance and implementation relationships of types in OOP allow alignment to more abstract types.
  * As we have already seen, `TypeInferencer` cannot define a type that is compatible with another type, because it has only unknown (`TVar`), `TInt`, `TBool`, and `TFun` types. These can be achieved by calculating a "constraint" on the unknown type to determine whether it is compatible or not.
* The inference result will always return only the type for the whole expression.
  * In the IDE, you need to use the inference results for the nodes of the partial syntax tree to suggest the types corresponding to the context positions, but `TypeInferencer` discards the types obtained in the middle of the inference.
  * This problem could be solved by storing the inference results for each node.

It would be a good idea to modify and add these from the `TypeInferencer` implementation. As a book that comprehensively covers the above, ["Introduction to Type Systems"](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) ([Japanese translation](https://www.ohmsha.co.jp/book/9784274069116/)) is famous, but However, the level of difficulty is quite high, so it is not suitable for beginners. It is better to check the basics with books on logic and symbolic logic first before proceeding.
