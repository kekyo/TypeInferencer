# How to play type inference

The original documentation can be found here: [TypeInferencer Repository](https://github.com/kekyo/TypeInferencer)

This document is intended for the following readers:

* Want to try `TypeInferencer`.
* Those who are interested in type inference and type inferencers.
* First-time learners of type inference and type inferencers.

The following are not explained:

* A detailed description of the internals of type inferencers ([Related articles](https://github.com/kekyo/TypeInferencer/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L12) and type theory. Also, the `TypeInferencer` is intended to be as plainly implemented as possible).

Please note that I am not familiar with it myself, so some parts may be incorrect. The purpose of this document is also to organize my understanding.

ï¼ˆThis document was written in Japanese and then translated into English by machine translation and reworked. I'd be very happy if you could help me out with any obvious grammar issues with PR, etc.)
